The Doctrine Project (or Doctrine) is a set of PHP libraries
 primarily focused on providing persistence services and related functionality. 
 Its prize projects are an object-relational mapper (ORM) 
 and the database abstraction layer it is built on top of it.
 
I have contributed to the project especially on the ORM component, 
introducing some features related to: 
 
- SLC (Second Level Cache)
- Composite Primary Keys
- XML Mapping
